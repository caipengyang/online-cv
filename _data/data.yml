    info:
      - role: Director of Engineering 
        time: Apr 2024 - Now
        company: Coupang
        details: |
          As the director of pricing engineering team, I'm collaborating with other teams including **Science**, **Analytics**, **Product** to assure the sharpness goal of our retail
          business. We are developing the pricing intelligence solutions to guarantee our price competitiveness among competitors in South Korea. We developed the automapping system
          and introduced different intelligent strategies to improve the business performance, such as SBC(search based crawling), VBS(vector based search) sparse retrieval and graph driven
          retrieval. 
            
          Meanwhile, we also finished the legacy systems deprecation successfully within 3 months and resolved the tech debts which last for more than 5 years. Now
          the whole team is focusing on improving the intelligence, scalability of the whole system from end to end leveraging AI technologies including traditional AI technologies like NLP, CV as
          well as LLM and LVLM. 

          > **Highlights**

            - Resolved 5 - year tech debts within my first two quarters
            `Our legacy system was built 5+ years ago and was not maintained well. It was using outdated big data solutions and the performance was not good. And the solution also couldn't scale as 
            business grows. Due to too many contributors and too many business requirements, the codebase was a mess and it makes the system hard to maintain and supporting any new feature was a nightmare.
            I led the team to redesign the system and rebuild the core components. We learned from the search & recommendation system architecture and came up with near realtime backend system solution and 
            eventually we built a high performance, scalable, and maintainable system. The throughput of the system was improved by 3X and the cost dropped by 85%. 
            And supporting new features was much easier than before and the architecture design, module relation, service framework as well as coding style is well defined.`

            - ...
          All these middlewares are initiated by my team and released & iterated with amazing efficiency, performance and stability. It was widely used in the company and successfully supported the 
          Shopee business growth from 2019 to 2024. Our solution are one of the major contributors improving shopee service SLA as well as supporting the big promotion events like 11.11, 12.12, 9.9, and so on.
